<p>Many have often wondered why conventional methods of <em>interstellar travel</em> are still necessary, now that the ability for humans to (with sufficient preparation and extreme mental exertion) bend space and time instantaneously has been demonstrated. The reason, as is often the case, is statistical. Based on the reported class sizes of the many self-proclaimed polytopological gynamisums in existence and the average graduation rate of those gymnasiums, there are approximately one million potential <strong>polytope navigators</strong> in the universe. Of those, there are around one hundred thousand working navigators today. The total size of the known human population within the galaxy is approximately one thousand billion, spread out over the forty home systems with a hundred terraformed or habitable worlds and countless managed biospheres. This means that, with an extremely generous reckoning, polytope navigators constitute about 0.00001%-0.0001% of the population. Every known polytope navigator is almost constantly employed, until after an average of ~325 jumps they suffer the inevitable neurological degeneration and burnout common to their profession. Navigators are one of the few human groups to have an average subjective lifespan under the thirty-epoch median.</p>
<p>No computational method of replicating the phenomenon we call <em>the shortening of the way</em> has been demonstrated in the 210108 epochs since the dawn of the New Era<sup id="fnref:4.1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4.1">1</a></sup>, making the use of a polytope navigator an extremely costly and (ironically) time-consuming endeavour. Arrangement for transport by navigator usually requires notification at least 100 epochs in advance<sup id="fnref:4.2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4.2">2</a></sup> and is reserved for the most delicate and sensitive of cargo. With white hole drives reaching 0.4-0.7c and being relatively cheap to manufacture, this is simply a waste of time for most purposes. The closest the galaxy came to the abolishment of interstellar travel was during wartime: Polytope Navigators were conscripted into system-wide collectives by both sides and deployed <em>en masse</em> during the <strong>Counter-Hegemonic Revolution</strong>, when the crown of Earth was broken and the Common Union relinquished all claims to human settlements beyond the Kuiper Belt<sup id="fnref:4.3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4.3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The interior of the space elevator terminus is panelled in a smooth utilitarian cream, the calming shade recognised by most human astronauts since birth. There are no humans on board, even though the station is non-folding and possesses crew quarters for three on-duty elevator operators. There is a clean and unused Common Duty Altar in the common room by a window, a bolted-down obelisk untouched by the <em>wabi-sabi</em> signs of pleading hands seeking solace. As Gecko and Teal float into the room, they take a moment to touch their forehead and grasp the cylinder of polished tungsten <sup id="fnref:5.god"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5.god">4</a></sup>. Their palms leave what appear to be the first sweat-stains on its surface, barely perceptible in the cream glow. THe fist-sized cylinder does not respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed is the seeker of the order of all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gecko, tired of negotiating through the ship to the station&rsquo;s strangely unresponsive control systems, crouches down and sets their fingers to work on the walls surrounding the Altar. Reaching almost directly behind the cylinder, they find a gap that they can pry open, revealing one of the backup access ports to the station&rsquo;s subnet <sup id="fnref:5.net"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5.net">5</a></sup>. There&rsquo;s a moment of fumbling as they pick at the cable access on their suit, then they yank out a thin length of gunmetal-grey cable and form a link from their wrist to the port itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; gibberish. Most of the subnet is damaged. There&rsquo;s only the automatic response handler that we triggered and&hellip; I can&rsquo;t find anything useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo; Teal holds out their hand, and Gecko reaches up to clasp it. The physical connection allows data to travel between them at a frequency otherwise impossible. Teal&rsquo;s hand is thick and burly, Gecko&rsquo;s thin and slim, the standard-issue jumpsuits making both a clean navy blue with light bumps for grip-friendly rubber padding. There&rsquo;s a soft chattering noise as Teal&rsquo;s teeth begin to click—a thinking noise. It&rsquo;s a strange moment: two astronauts, one crouched in front of a cylinder, the other standing tall and looking up while framed against a porthole. The grey planet is slowly tilting behind them, clasped hands linking them both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The space elevator still works. We&rsquo;d have to trigger it manually, but all the procedures are just dead low-level machine code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did someone get here before us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No idea. Nothing logged, nothing forwarded from the planetary subnet. Hell, ever since we docked I&rsquo;m having trouble figuring out if the system is even doing load balancing correctly—&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pause as Gecko and Teal think through this sentence. Teal spins to look at the porthole. &ldquo;The planet is tilting. Oh fuck, it&rsquo;s <em>tilting</em>, it&rsquo;s—&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a splintering noise and the unmistakable sound of the depressurisation alarm. Outside the porthole, the <em>Homo erectus</em> spins into view, bits of the broken airlock still attached. The common room exit leading towards the docking bay seals shut with a soft hiss, the dirty grey of the emergency airlock door breaking the smooth cream unity of the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The station control system is dead in the water, Gecko. There&rsquo;s no automatic thruster adjustments. That means that we&rsquo;re slipping out of geostationary orbit, and probably have been for a while. The docking was just the final straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to abort.&rdquo; Gecko looks pale, and he rubs a bit of stubble worriedly. That stubble had begun to grow on the fields of New Cambria, accompanied by the soft whistling of wind through the trees and the chatter of birdsong. &ldquo;We need to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? These aren&rsquo;t EVA suits, and our ride&rsquo;s just been forcibly deorbited. We need to get down to the planet now, or wait here and go down the hard way.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Once the decision is made there&rsquo;s almost nothing left to do. Both of the crew run into the central elevator shaft of the terminus, cramming themselves into the crew pod and launching it manually without the cursory safety inspections that would have normally preceded such a gesture. They try not to think about the state of the terminus behind them in the cramped darkness of the crew capsule, lit only by the glow of useless status panels. They try not to listen to the screeching sounds behind them, or be disturbed by the violent rocking as the capsule descends into the atmosphere of <strong>Georgius V</strong>.</p>

<p>This failure has led to persistent arguments that dyson computers, even those that capture ten or twenty percent of a normal star&rsquo;s energy output and perfectly simulate dynamic systems the size of ant farms, are not truly sentient. While most of the population have never seen a navigator in the flesh, this fact bolsters their belief in humanity&rsquo;s uniqueness nonetheless.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4.1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
