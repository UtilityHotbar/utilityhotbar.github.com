<p>Many have often wondered why conventional methods of <em>interstellar travel</em> are still necessary, now that the ability for humans to (with sufficient preparation and extreme mental exertion) bend space and time instantaneously has been demonstrated. The reason, as is often the case, is statistical. Based on the reported class sizes of the many self-proclaimed polytopological gynamisums in existence and the average graduation rate of those gymnasiums, there are approximately one million potential <strong>polytope navigators</strong> in the universe. Of those, there are around one hundred thousand working navigators today. The total size of the known human population within the galaxy is approximately one thousand billion, spread out over the forty home systems with a hundred terraformed or habitable worlds and countless managed biospheres. This means that, with an extremely generous reckoning, polytope navigators constitute about 0.00001%-0.0001% of the population. Every known polytope navigator is almost constantly employed, until after an average of ~325 jumps they suffer the inevitable neurological degeneration and burnout common to their profession. Navigators are one of the few human groups to have an average subjective lifespan under the thirty-epoch median.</p>
<p>No computational method of replicating the phenomenon we call <em>the shortening of the way</em> has been demonstrated in the 210108 epochs since the dawn of the New Era<sup id="fnref:4.1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4.1">1</a></sup>, making the use of a polytope navigator an extremely costly and (ironically) time-consuming endeavour. Arrangement for transport by navigator usually requires notification at least 100 epochs in advance<sup id="fnref:4.2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4.2">2</a></sup> and is reserved for the most delicate and sensitive of cargo. With white hole drives reaching 0.4-0.7c and being relatively cheap to manufacture, this is simply a waste of time for most purposes. The closest the galaxy came to the abolishment of interstellar travel was during wartime: Polytope Navigators were conscripted into system-wide collectives by both sides and deployed <em>en masse</em> during the <strong>Counter-Hegemonic Revolution</strong>, when the crown of Earth was broken and the Common Union relinquished all claims to human settlements beyond the Kuiper Belt<sup id="fnref:4.3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4.3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The interior of the space elevator terminus is panelled in a smooth utilitarian cream, the calming shade recognised by most human astronauts since birth. There are no humans on board, even though the station is non-folding and possesses crew quarters for three on-duty elevator operators. There is a clean and unused Common Duty Altar on board, its bolted-down obelisk untouched by the <em>wabi-sabi</em> signs of pleading hands seeking solace. As Gecko and Teal float into the room, they take a moment to touch their forehead and grasp the cylinder of polished tungsten <sup id="fnref:5.god"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5.god">4</a></sup>. Their palms leave what appear to be the first sweat-stains on its surface, barely perceptible in the cream glow.</p>

<p>This failure has led to persistent arguments that dyson computers, even those that capture ten or twenty percent of a normal star&rsquo;s energy output and perfectly simulate dynamic systems the size of ant farms, are not truly sentient. While most of the population have never seen a navigator in the flesh, this fact bolsters their belief in humanity&rsquo;s uniqueness nonetheless.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4.1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>At that time it was even possible for ships to be raided, when navigators would fold themselves and squadrons of deathmakers into the exact trajectory of an approaching craft. That megadeaths were only occasional occurences during this conflict remains a true miracle and a testament to the human race&rsquo;s love of peace.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4.3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Though this period has often been described as &ldquo;godless&rdquo; or otherwise &ldquo;atheist&rdquo;, godless times demand godless beliefs of their own.
