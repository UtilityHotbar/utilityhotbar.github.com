<h3 id="1">1</h3>
<p>A massive toroid of carbon fibre and titanium cuts through a void that stretches on for lightminutes in every direction. At the centre of the ring, a captured white hole spits out a constant stream of charged particles at high speed. These are emissions that (once shaped and ejected in the direction of thrust) drive the ship forward, but their movement and the charge they carry also powers the ship&rsquo;s navigation, control, and life support systems. With a tau-class white hole rated for at least a thousand epochs of steady emissions, the <em>Homo erectus</em> can travel between neighbouring stars without the assistance of a costly polytope navigator.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next few weeks, the ship&rsquo;s target grows from a distant speck amongst the echoes of dead stars into something that registers to the ship&rsquo;s sensors as a small, greyish circle. This is the planet <strong>Georgius V</strong>, the destination of the ship&rsquo;s cargo. The <em>Homo erectus</em> now moves to deccelerate: guided by a deterministic polytope computer, parts of the ship move out of higher dimensional space into the three-dimensional projection presented by the craft when viewed through three-dimensional eyes. From an external frame of reference the ship appears to grow three prongs, spaced out evenly along the torus and rapidly expanding into three arrowhead shapes that cut into the ship&rsquo;s curved surface—traditional thrusters with chemical fuel for the final stages of decceleration, when it is necessary to fold away the white hole. Once the thrusters are fixed, the electromagnets shaping the white hole&rsquo;s output invert their polarity, and the ship now directs its thrust towards instead of away from <strong>Georgius V</strong>.</p>
<p>Also projected into three-dimensional space are the crew of the <em>Homo erectus</em>. For them, the journey would have taken less than five subjective seconds, while that same external reference frame would say that a century had passed from the moment the polytope computer fully deactivated after exiting Earth&rsquo;s orbit to the moment that same computer activated again as it neared Georgius V. The Captain, Ambitious-Gecko Huang, takes a few seconds to regain his footing after the ship rocks lightly, the life support rings locking into place alongside the solid fuel reserves that were the biggest hazard on the ship. The copilot and polyhedron (3-space) systems engineer Teal Dreamland Counter-hegemonic FranzFanon chants out the numbers entering their head into a newly established local subnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shortening of way, no zeroth payload integrity check. 3-space deployment integrity check: 99.999983% 4-space payload deployed, integrity check passed. 99.954388% 5-space payload deployed, integrity check passed. Restoration strategy complete. Biosphere constraints met and biosphere policy is sustainable. Handover from autopilot complete. Captain, you have a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Teal.&rdquo; The captain walks along a section of the torus that, up until five minutes ago, was entirely empty, but now houses a crew quarters and a slate of backup viewscreens in case the subnet goes down. In an entirely ritual and meaningless gesture, he places his hands on the console, which obediently hums to life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calculate landing solution for Georgius V. I authorise and complete our passage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A <strong>polytope</strong> is the extension of a polyhedron into arbitrary dimensions. With the understanding that the conservation of information and matter must remain intact, a temporary mapping of 3-space (technically referred to as <code>s3</code>) into 4-space (<code>s4</code>) or 5-space (<code>s5</code>) allows for many advantages: the compact storage of large amounts of matter while remaining structurally coherent in the higher dimension, the storage of biological organisms in a manner such that they are effectively placed in suspended animation, and the maintenance of mathematical and aesthetic preferences while doing so. </p>
<p>The precise process of folding is difficult to explain (even to Polytope Navigators, who are trained for this exact purpose), but a history will assist with understanding. With the New Era discovery that the universe, while 3-dimensional, can support an arbitrary number of dimensions, this theory remained to be experimentally proven. The necessary local calculations to map <code>s3</code> into <code>s4</code> or <code>s5</code> space were completed by ReRamanujan of the Immortal Church with the assistance of a 3 percent Dyson machine mind known as <code>{all x | map(x) = x AND x in R} = {}</code> <sup id="fnref:2.1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2.1">1</a></sup>. These calculations, once performed for a given area, warp the laws of physics. This can be verified with a modified Xiao-Bell test that now demonstrates the existence of local hidden variables: namely, that 2 entangled <code>s3</code> particles have actually become a singular <code>s4</code> particle projecting into two locations in <code>s3</code> at once. Even if they are lightyears apart, information travels instantaneously between two entangled particles in this paradigm, because they are in fact the same particle. A level of information that violates established <code>s3</code> quantum mechanics can therefore be known about these entangled particles. </p>
<p>Further experiments showed that it was possible to, through the application of certain calculations and observations, induce entanglement between objects or parts of objects, and further manipulate the mapping calculations to move them in or out of entanglement. This advancement allowed for the &ldquo;folding&rdquo; of matter we know today. Critically, it has been shown that this experiment only succeeds while these mapping calculations are being performed by an observer of the experiment <sup id="fnref:2.2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2.2">2</a></sup>. To make use of such higher dimensional spaces, therefore, requires either a computer or a human capable of sustained complex mathematical thought for long periods of time. Most ships therefore are not constantly folding, but rather have several states and a polytope computer that is used to transition between states. Curiously, it should be noted that the most advanced form of folding, where the entire ship and the observer are folded into some higher dimensional space which is then warped to allow for near instantaneous transport across the universe, has only been achieved by special augmented humans. These are, of course, the <strong>polytope navigators</strong>, whose presence indicates a combination of training, talent, and extreme personal sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="3">3</h3>
<p>With an effective mapping radius barely larger than the ship&rsquo;s maximum 3-space radius, it was unlikely that the polytope computer onboard the <em>Homo erectus</em> could cause much disruption to Georgius V as it approached. Still, standard operating procedure was to complete any polytopological operations before entering any significant gravity well, and those procedures were rarely violated. <sup id="fnref:3.1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3.1">3</a></sup> There was a reason why, besides carefully controlled lab experiments, most polytope calculations operated in the great emptiness of space.</p>
<p>The ship is slowing now, the thrusters firing, ancient but foolproof technologies from the old eras sputtering to life as the white hole blinks out of existence. With lagrangian precision the craft enters a stable geostationary orbit, and soon it approaches the space elevator that will send Gecko and Teal to the surface. From this point of view the installation looks like a jellyfish with a single, extremely long tentacle, a dome-shaped bulb of a space station gleaming in the cold light of a dwarf star. <strong>Grey</strong> is the station and the elevator. <strong>Grey</strong> is the swirling mass of gas that obscures the planet below. <strong>Grey</strong> (but not entiely so) is the <em>Homo erectus</em>, its surface pitted with micrometeorite scars and its thrusters growling in bright neon orange. Soon the orange will fade, and the grey picture will be complete.</p>
