# UtilityHotbar

## About me
* I have been coding since ~2018.
* I program [simulations](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/civsim), [tools](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/showmd/), [toy compilers/languages](https://zhengzi-archive.com/terminal/), [games](progress_game/index.html), and [multimedia projects/ARGs](https://zhengzi-archive.com/)
* My research interests include Large Language Models (e.g. [GPT-3](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3)), AI safety/interpretability (e.g. occlusion sensitivity), Natural Language Processing (e.g. topic modelling, generating parse trees, and POS tagging) and the implications of digitisation and automation in [societies of control](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/gilles-deleuze-postscript-on-the-societies-of-control).

## Major Projects
* [**Civsim**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/civsim) - Automated generation of civilisations and simulation of their growth and decay.
* [**Journey**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/journey) - Automated D&D questing.
* [**Shellsim**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/shellsim) - A self-contained simulation of a bash like shell: piping, streaming, internal filesystem
* [**Zhengzi Archive**](https://zhengzi-archive.com/) - Online facing part of an ARG I ran.

## Games
* [**NOVOS Emulator**](https://zhengzi-archive.com/terminal/) - An assembly language programming game with a Zachtronics-style manual and 5 levels.
* [**Saturday Night One Shot**](https://nakade.itch.io/saturday-night-one-shot) - D&D themed, simple roguelike with a hand-drawn aesthetic based on [rough.js](https://roughjs.com/).
* [**The Diplomat**](https://nakade.itch.io/diplomat) - Text adventure game made using [ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).

## Minor Projects
* [**Showmd**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/showmd/) - Displays markdown files in a semi-pretty way in the shell.
* [**oldbook.css**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/oldbook-css) - A CSS theme that simulates old books. For some reason, my most popular project by far. No JS needed.
* [**neoweb.css**](https://utilityhotbar.github.io/neoweb/) - Another CSS theme, with a demo page. No JS needed.
* [**ARG Tools**](https://utilityhotbar.github.io/args/) - Tools for running and making ARGs.

## Old Stuff
* [**Progress Game**](https://utilityhotbar.github.io/progress_game) - Short incremental game with [paper.css](https://www.getpapercss.com/).
* [**Bytedelver**](https://utilityhotbar.github.io/bytedelver/) - Unfinished roguelike using [rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) and [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/).
* [**Mass Defect**](https://utilityhotbar.github.io/alchemy/html/site-main/index.html) - Unfinished alchemy-themed incremental game.
