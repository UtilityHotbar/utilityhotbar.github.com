# UtilityHotbar

## About me
* I have been coding since ~2018.
* I program [simulations](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/civsim), [tools](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/showmd/), [toy compilers/languages](https://zhengzi-archive.com/terminal/), [games](progress_game/index.html), and [multimedia projects/ARGs](https://zhengzi-archive.com/)
* My research interests include Large Language Models (e.g. [GPT-3](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3)), AI safety/interpretability (e.g. occlusion sensitivity), Natural Language Processing (e.g. topic modelling, generating parse trees, and POS tagging) and the implications of digitisation and automation in [societies of control](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/gilles-deleuze-postscript-on-the-societies-of-control).

## Major Projects
* [**Civsim**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/civsim) - Automated generation of civilisations and simulation of their growth and decay.
* [**Journey**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/journey) - Automated D&D dungeon diving.
* [**Shellsim**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/shellsim) - A self-contained simulation of a bash like shell: piping, streaming, internal filesystem
