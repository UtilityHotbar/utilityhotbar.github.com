- Tiktok can be a trap: high numbers, high demand for constant content, low actual engagement. It was like that for me.

- Presentation is key to engagement. Creating a sense of versimilitude (this *could* be real) is more important than absolute realism (this *is* real), and allows for investment from the players. Besides, sometimes we *don't* want absolute realism (don't use real addresses or websites not owned by you, don't incentivise criminal behaviour etc.)

- If you break the suspension of disbelief, you should try to repair it rather than ignore it. Work the leak into the story somehow...
