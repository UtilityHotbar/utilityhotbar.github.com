<p><em>In which I offer some explanation for my churlish words—Pour elle—Un
jour je serai de retour prés de toi</em></p>
<p>There is something wrong in the world. Sometimes it feels like I’m
living a double life. In one world, I want to worry about dating and
getting a stable job and my career and what my parents think. In that
world I get to grow old and retire into obscurity. I get to spend my
days doing something not-too-harmful, probably involving computers, and
spend my free time enjoying my hobbies. (I wanted, when I was young,
more than anything else, to be a designer of toys and games.) In this
world capitalism works, democracy works, the trees are green and the sky
is blue. This is the world that capitalism promised for us, that career
advisors and high school principles promised for us, that politicians
and the news and most books still promise for us. It is also
increasingly no longer the world I believe I live in.</p>
<p>In the world outside my window, in the world I see on my phone screen
and reflected in the eyes of my friends, it is much worse than we all
think. There is an air of panic and anger, anger at a future we will
never get, hatred for those whom we blame for taking it from us. The
trees are turning grey and the sky is bleeding red: Red from the smoke
and the flame, red from the madness and the terror inside our hearts.
Maybe you feel this too, that a hurricane is headed for us all, a
hurricane that uproots social systems and ecosystems and our very
concept of world and time. You cannot negotiate with a hurricane.</p>
<p>The distance between these two worlds drives me crazy. Half of me says
that I’ve lost my mind, that I have delusions of grandeur and some
apocalyptic tendency. The other half screams that I’m standing by while
the world burns, plucking a lyre and designing my little amusements.
I’ve written versions of this essay over and over again. Every time, it
seems like the situation gets worse. Every time, I use less and less
elaborate language, less and less obfuscation. Every time I can see the
truth a little more clearly, the truth that I try to hide from myself
even now. Here I quote Peter Watts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not claiming that I don’t tell my stories against a dystopian
backdrop. Take the Rifters trilogy, for example. The desperate
rearguard against ongoing environmental collapse, the
neurochemically-enslaved bureaucrats deciding which part of the world
they’ll incinerate today to hold back the latest plague, the
exploitation of abuse victims to run power plants on the deep-ocean
floor — none of this is the stuff of Hallmark Theatre. But in a very
real sense, these are not my inventions; they are essential features
of any plausible vision of the future. The thing that distinguishes
science fiction, after all — what sets it apart from magic realism and
horror and the rest of speculative horde— is that is fiction based on
science. It has to be at least semiplausible in its extrapolations
from here to there.</p>
<p>Where can we go, from here? Where can we go, starting with seven
billion hominins who can’t control their appetites, who wipe out
thirty species a day with the weight of their bootprints, who are too
busy rejecting evolution and building killer drones to notice that the
icecaps are melting? How do you write a plausible near-future in which
we somehow stopped the flooding and the water wars, in which we didn’t
wipe out entire ecosystems and turn millions into environmental
refugees?</p>
<p>You can’t. That ship — that massive, lumbering, world-sized ship — has
already sailed, and it turns so very slowly. The only way you can head
off those consequences by 2050 is by telling a tale in which we got
serious about climate change back in the nineteen-seventies — and then
you’re not talking science fiction any more, you’re talking fantasy.</p>
<p>— Peter Watts, “Are We There Yet? En Route to Dystopia with the Angry
Optimist”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with him that any writing grounded in reality, fiction or not,
gets more grim by the day. I agree that the future will contain horrors
that make today seem impossibly utopian. Where I differ from him is the
idea that this is somehow some fatal flaw of <em>homo sapiens</em>, that we are
somehow destined to destroy ourselves because of some dark nature of
ours. I still believe that complex collectives can change and improve.</p>
<p>So that comes back to these essays. They are my way of squaring the
circle, of planting the tree now that should have been planted twenty
years ago. It is my hope that the tools we can develop, assistive tools
that claim their lineage from <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC and
HCI</a></u> rather than the
sterile profiteering of Jobs and Gates, can make us better at figuring
out coordination and cooperation. I hope that being able to process data
and spot patterns at scale will allow us to see through deception, find
useful heuristics, and address problems before they arise. I think
allowing 8 billion people to coexist on a planet is a difficult problem
and I want to try and help solve it somehow by providing better
frameworks for thinking about problems like that. Call it a moonshot,
call it delusional: That is why all the text on these pages, all the
code I have linked, is free to redistribute and reuse. I would rather
someone take my ideas and make them work than lay claim to dead
thoughts. I want to buy humanity time to solve their problems. The
problems won’t slow down, so we need to accelerate the way humanity
thinks collectively.</p>
<p>Finally, I ask of you only this. Read these words and disbelieve them,
if you want. Call me crazy and delusional, if you want. But if there is
something hopeful or helpful that you want to do, some intervention you
think has a chance in hell of improving the world we live in, try it
<em>now</em>. Don’t wait.</p>
<p>It only gets harder from here.</p>
