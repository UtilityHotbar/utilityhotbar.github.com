<p><em>In which I attempt to renegotiate rationalism as a political
philosophy, and offer my alternative—A king is not a
micromanager—Decentralisation can save the world</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I lay out what I see to be the political implications of
rationalism, and try to offer an alternative worldview for solving high
level cooperation and coordination problems.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly-side-of-things">The Ugly Side of Things</h2>
<p>So far, I have not laid my cards on the table as to why I am writing
this essay. It seems clear to me that the four core beliefs I laid out
in “Defining Rationalism” place rationalists and their ideological
neighbours at a high risk of ideological radicalisation to conservative
and far-right causes. This is generally done by extrapolating the third
principle to the idea that the smart and agentic should direct the
affairs of the <em>hoi polloi</em> due to their inability to self-govern, along
with adopting a dim view of human cooperation that leads to the adoption
of “might makes right” strategies. It also leads to a libertarian
impulse which resists social constraints and sees social conventions as
entirely retrograde and not worthy of respecting, eroding the social
ties of rationalist participants in the process. There is also a large
element of potential overlap with scientific racism (so-called “Human
Bio-Diversity”): Once it can be “determined factually” that one
sub-group of humans is more intelligent than another, the intellectual
supremacism that has already been established justifies depriving the
less intellectual of equal standing in society. It is a lie to say that
rationalism is compatible with every value set, because not every value
set values “winning”, and the supremacy that entails <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Of course, the rationalists would say that, however repugnant such
conclusions might be to conventional morality, they are the best way of
analysing the world we have before us. However, what if there was an
alternative?</p>
<h2 id="there-is-another-way">There is another way</h2>
<p>It seems clear to me that, if we aim to dethrone an ideology constructed
on the supposed rigorous study of reality, then we must make sure that
any alternative world-model we propose have at least as much explanatory
power as the original. It should also enable instrumental and ethical
outcomes superior to rationalism, otherwise rationalism would still
remain the best way of achieving your goals even if its world-model is
incorrect. We must win more and win better, so to speak. In that light,
I tried to generalise some of the ideas behind conscious reinvestment to
broader systemic principles. Here’s my best shot:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The world can be understood as complex systems that are constructed
    based on complex, nonlinear principles of interaction - these models
    escape the understanding of any individual or group of individuals
    due to their irreducible complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing heuristics about and influence over these systems enables
    us to solve high level problems (social coordination, communication,
    ai alignment). This is best done by distributing agency and enabling
    anti-fragile local self-improvement rather than top-down
    orchestrated optimisation and change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The efficiency of a decentralised system increases the more agents
    are empowered to locally self-optimise and coordinate. Therefore,
    any promotion of knowledge about these systems and the truth of
    nonlinear influence increases the total compute capacity of the
    human race and improves the distributed system’s performance at
    every level.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And hence the fourth principle - By thinking about this problem, you
take on the responsibility to explain this problem to others and get as
many brains online to tackle this problem as possible. Loosely speaking,
one million minds are better than one hundred, no matter how smart the
one hundred are.</p>
<h2 id="the-perfect-case-of-governance-is-no-governance">The Perfect Case of Governance is No Governance</h2>
<p>In the previous section I have brought up the idea of decentralisation.
It is necessary for me now to define it more rigorously.</p>
<p>The ideal case of governance is often presented as a supremely wise
philosopher-king, one who makes all decisions justly and whose word is
law, turning those perfect decisions into perfect actions <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. But, if
we accept the constraint that such a perfect being could exist and be
identified at all, surely the best case scenario is that all citizens of
a kingdom are such perfect beings? In such a world, the kingdom governs
itself without error, every citizen instantly knowing the best solution
to cooperate to solve any issue that arises. So we establish that the
perfect case of governance is that no governance is necessary. How does
it apply to the real world?</p>
<h2 id="fucking-around-and-finding-out">Fucking around and finding out</h2>
<p>As an example of a useful heuristic I have learned through painful
experience, I will now present my account of why erroneous theories and
systems persist for so long, and cause so much harm when they fail (e.g.
the financial order behind the 2008 financial crash). The heuristic is
this: the longer you fuck around, the worse it is for you when you find
out. To be slightly more specific, the longer it takes for a theory or
proposition to be tested, the worse the consequences are if it is
invalid.</p>
<p>Imagine wearing a backpack with only one strap. This is less secure than
wearing your backpack with two straps, and if you trip the backpack may
dramatically swing out and throw you off balance, but in general this is
not a problem. If you trip early on while wearing a backpack like this
and catch yourself, you’ll probably put the backpack on properly and
continue on your way. However, if you don’t trip early on, you might
fool yourself into thinking that this is a stable situation. Then you
pick up a drink with one hand… a box of chicken nuggets in the other…
maybe a shoelace eventually gets undone… When the tripping hazard
eventually comes it’ll be a lot more awkward than a momentary wobble.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is a limited heuristic: your theory that you can
outrun a car will be swiftly tested and the consequences will still be
extremely dire from your perspective despite less than 3 seconds
transpiring between theory and test. However, when constructing systems,
I propose that the longer a system has to wait before it comes under
stress the worse the results will be. In general, systems grow
labyrinthine with no pressure to stay resilient and errors compound
silently in non-stressed states. A casual example of this is the global
network of Just-In-Time logistics, founded on the belief that ships will
always arrive on time and that stockpiles need only carry exactly as
much stock as is needed to manufacture a product because losses during
production are predictable and minimal <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. Constructed in a time
before the consequences of climate change were evident, the system has
had some 70 years to accrue errors of judgement and critical
dependencies <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. The worsening weather will finally show us how bad
those errors of judgement are.</p>
<p>This heuristic is a quasi-adaption of Taleb’s concept of antifragility,
where small shocks to a system actually strengthen it if it can learn
from those shocks. Here, I position that systems that can rapidly
iterate over feedback (i.e. learn from mistakes without too much time
lag for their errors to become established doctrine) are more efficient
than those systems that will not or cannot. In practice, while some
degree of organisation is needed to coordinate effectively, having local
units free to react to situations as they arise allows them to iterate
more rapidly and get a better grip on the situation. We contrast this
against the failures of top-down systems of control such as those in the
Soviet Union, or the failure of the Federal Reserve to prevent economic
crises in America. <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> If we accept the general proposition that those
closer to an event (physically or socially) have more information about
it, the idea of decentralisation becomes a lossy approximation of the
kingdom of perfect philosopher-kings. Each unit is still making
decisions quasi-independently, but under the aegis of a larger whole
which manages coordination and larger issues <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="levels-of-organisation">Levels of Organisation</h2>
<p>At this point, much has been offered in terms of high level abstraction.
How do these supposed principles play out in practice? To even partially
answer that question I will have to do something that I have in the last
part accused rationalists of doing: turning complex real world
phenomenae into abstract systems. Specifically, I would like to compare
decision making systems to computer networksr or signal transmission
systems.</p>
<p>Lest I be accused of hypocrisy, I will now point out the constraints
such a high level model places on the environments I am seeking to
model. I am generally modelling a system with no overtly malicious
actors or saboteurs, or at least one where they are sufficiently rare as
to be anomalies. The components in a signal processing system have fixed
efficiencies and fixed utility functions, things real people rarely
possess as constants for long amounts of time. In general, I assume that
people are generally decent, working to something like their overall
capabilities, and largely working cooperatively. An example case where
this analogy fails apart: common strategy in signal transmission
networks is to throw in a repeater every now and then to strengthen the
signal and suppress noise. When people do it, it’s called Chinese
Whispers, and the signal gets way, way worse.</p>
<p>What does this framework offer? Once we see individual bureaucrats or
social officers as components in a greater information network, some
features of organisation immediately become clear. Many <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reigns_(video_game)">video
games</a></u> and media
that feature kings portray them as effectively nothing more than
national micromanagers, resolving their petitioner’s claims one by one
and setting standards that apply to the whole of their domain. In
practice, such a system would be almost impossible without computational
capacities far beyond that of a human or group of humans: total top down
control would mean that a kingdom becomes a star network, every terminal
requesting information and depositing information to a central server,
quickly overloading it at scales of more than even fifty users.
Similarly, the slowdowns brought about bureaucracy become easy to model:
the speed of information transmission in a chain of signal repeaters is
bottlenecked by the efficiency of the slowest repeater. Systems where
multiple parties must sign off on the same task or approve the same form
also become upper-bounded by the speed of the slowest worker.</p>
<p>A birds-eye view of societies as information systems also allows us to
appreciate the <em>statistical</em> function of the state, what Foucault refers
to as <em>biopower</em> <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. This is best illustrated, as Foucault does, with
the example of “law and order”: Consider the mundane securitarian, the
beat cop. For him, crime and order are individual questions, discrete
assignments he can succeed or fail at. A thief let loose is a single,
real, entity who shall commit tangible harms, a person with whom it is
possible to have a relationship of admiration, anger, or hatred. Insofar
as he concerns himself with the community’s continued security it is in
real and conceivable terms of knowable persons who live in that locale.
So-and-so has been robbed, so-and-so murdered.</p>
<p>Now consider the Director of Police, or the Minister for Security. His
concerns stretch out both in terms of space and in time, he concerns
himself not with neighbourhoods but national districts, not with
moment-to-moment assignments but broad trends of crime and punishment.
The success metric here is probabilistic, that is to say non-discrete.
It does not matter if a single cop catches a single thief, what matters
is the percentage of cops who catch a percentage of thieves. Returning
to the metaphor of social systems as information systems, mesh networks
such as the internet demonstrate a similar property in that the general
success of a message-passing directive depends not on the individual
performance of any node, but rather on the overall performance of
sufficient nodes in the mesh network.</p>
<p>But it would be a mistake to conclude that only Ministers of Security
view these problems in such a way. Compared to the individual doctor,
the Minister for Health in the neighbouring building takes a similar
approach to his securitarian counterpart: while for a local doctor it
matters personally if their patient lives or dies, the Minister for
Health deals in broad statistical categories. They do not consider
Joanna the overworked single mother with stage III lung cancer, they
consider the group of all single mothers in long term care. Insofar as
these directors and ministers and presidents concern themselves with
individual cases, it is because they have become prominent enough to
affect the psychological landscape and therefore the broader trends
which form the system—or that they have become obsessed with some model
problem which is often not in fact the broader phenomenon it is a cypher
for. The paradigms are incomparable, more has shown itself again to be
different.</p>
<p>And it is not even that these two perspectives are in conflict: if the
local doctors no longer cared about individual patients, the overall
trends of national healthcare would suffer, and if the overall trends
were not considered local doctors would not receive adequate centralised
resources with which to care for individual patients. If the beat cop
started reasoning in overall trends and no longer caring about
individual assignments, he would fail in his securitarian task and harm
the broader securitarian project. This micro-macro syncopation explains
the so-called Voter’s Paradox: while in the broadest sense voting trends
are based on population level distributions, these distributions are
constituted through the local-level belief that individual decisions are
important and matter; and the broader scale implications of these
distributed local decisions gives each local decision weight and
importance. One cannot exist without the other <sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="society-as-a-black-box">Society as a Black Box</h2>
<p>A further benefit of considering society as an information system with
defined processes and utilities (<u><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html">each with their preset inputs and
outputs</a></u>) is
that society itself can now be considered as a totality, a system with
its own defined set of inputs and outputs. In aggregate, then, societies
take in resources of various kinds (labour, capital, natural) and
produces services for its members (food, water, shelter, electricity).
We can describe the <em>efficiency</em> of a society as the disparity between,
for example, the energy it takes in from livestock, agriculture and
transport; and compare that to the amount of food it produces with that
energy. However, we must be careful to separate overproduction and waste
from actual useful production: in other words, we measure calories taken
in and compare that to calories produced <em>and consumed by a society’s
members</em>, rather than also accounting for, say, wasted food that goes
straight to a landfill. Similarly, we can aim for reducing duplicate
labour, wasted time etc.</p>
<p>If alarm bells aren’t ringing already, they should be. The crude version
of this optimisation process led to the so-called optimised supply
chains of Just-in-Time logistics, which we have discussed already. The
<u><a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/optimal-amount-of-fraud/">optimal amount of fraud is not
zero</a></u>,
and the optimal amount of slippage/redundancy is <em>definitely</em> not zero
in a world with freak storms and heat waves in February. Furthermore, we
can begin to quantify statements like “capitalism is not fit for
purpose” by examining what outputs the existing information networks of
society accelerate and incentivise. A full version of this analysis is
beyond the scope of this essay, but suffice it to say that we perhaps
owe more to the legacy pre-industrial contexts that we have inherited
than we do to capitalism the bread on our table today <sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>. And, of
course, once one obtains this high level view of society’s functions,
one further understands the impossibility of directing a million, much
less eight billion, people.</p>
<h2 id="other-pragmatic-arguments-for-decentralisation">Other Pragmatic Arguments for Decentralisation</h2>
<p>Beyond such high level, conceptual arguments, more pragmatic arguments
can be made for the “chunking” or decentralisation of society. Consider
the following chain of argument (and the contextual presumptions it
takes as axiomatic!):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are only capable of a limited number of personal connections
    beyond immediate ties, approximately 100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We work best when working with people we understand personally and
    can empathise with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, we are most empathic and helpful within these personal
    bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Society is improved when its members are empathic, helpful, and can
    work together efficiently.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This suggests that, rather than a centralised “<em>beamtersstadt</em>” relying
on anonymous bureaucracy to manage millions, a society consisting of
self-organised social units that work not by abstract principles of
ideology but rather by close-knit community bonds would feature less
fracturing and conflict. Taleb addresses this approach in his
description of the cantonal organisation of Switzerland, which he refers
to as the most successful country in the world. He attributes this
success to their relatively weak central government and strong local
social participation. The removal of cold bureaucratic abstraction would
also reduce the likelihood of harmful decisions being inflicted on
people by anonymous others with no understanding of the impact of their
actions.</p>
<h2 id="dignity-without-supremacy">Dignity without Supremacy</h2>
<p>If we take into account the concept of decentralisation, then we begin
to dissolve the intellectual hierarchy/meritocracy framework that
underlies rationalism’s affinity with the right. After all, the
principle of meritocracy is that a society needs to elect or promote
those most qualified (by some metric ordained from above) to operate it
in a centralised fashion. By contrast, a decentralised society might
have many such centres of operation at a mesoscale, with intervention
between clusters or groups occurring only in times of shared need. The
goal becomes not to subjugate, control, or otherwise <em>manage</em> those less
intelligent than you, but to empower them to contribute to the
collective thinking-effort of society at whatever level suits them best.
Once the oppositional framing is removed, cooperation becomes much
easier, even straightforwardly rational.</p>
<p>There are those who will say that these words are only possible in our
modern, degenerate, toothless age, where all conflict is mediated and
the inner brutality of man is hemmed in by civilised watchmen on all
sides. There are those who would further posit that, should this veneer
of civility be stripped back, the strong (by which they always mean
themselves) will inevitably emerge and reshape the world in their image.
However, I would venture to argue the opposite: that it is this
anonymised, alienated society that allows cruelty to flourish. In a vast
and impersonal system the worst that can happen (socially, at least) is
that you are required to relocated to another anonymous corner to
continue your cruel acts. Society creates systems of faceless workers to
enable monsters to access food, water, and fresh victims by accruing
power and money, establishing barriers of plausible deniability between
sociopath CEOs and those they wound and injure. Whereas, in the
counterfactual world where the community is small and survival
difficult, a tyrant’s grip is (though harder perhaps to disturb
initially) much more of a brittle thing, with no recourse for the Roman
king if his subjects revolt. Writing in just such a time of tumult,
Macchiavelli understood this principle well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has
only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can
easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by
keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for
him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most
efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is
not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires
against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but
when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will
not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that
confront a conspirator are infinite.</p>
<p>— Niccolo Macchiavelli, <em>The Prince</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore take care not to assume that what is ruthless and bloody is
natural, nor that what is soft and gentle-seeming is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>Recall again that rationalism is path-dependent, that games where you
can win are poor metaphors for life, that perfect prediction and control
are near-impossible. In this schema, I argue, any top-down plan for
world optimisation is misguided—doomed to failure by the sheer scope
required. I understand that the alternative I present can be attacked as
its own particular form of baseless theory. But it did not seem right to
criticise without offering my own alternative, so I hope it is of some
interest, at least, to think about.</p>
