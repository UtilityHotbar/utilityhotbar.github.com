<p><em>In which I explain what this is about—Some notes on how I write—The
beginning of the end, the end of the beginning</em></p>

<p>By October, I will be 22. 22 is too old, as they say, to pretend you’re
young. It’s the end of any “transition year”, and adulthood where I come
from is defined as turning 18 anyways. At the same time, I will leave
university, having completed a BA in English and a Master’s degree in
Digital Humanities in Cambridge. For some more information about the
work I’ve done, feel free to check out the rest of my
<u><a href="https://utilityhotbar.github.io/">website</a></u> and
<u><a href="https://github.com/utilityHotbar/">Github</a></u>.</p>
<p>A note on process: The title of this series is inspired by <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9N7Awpk9lE">this
Jacob Geller video</a></u>.
Most of these essays were written during and immediately before a trip
to the <u><a href="https://www.edfringe.com/">Edinburgh Fringe festival</a></u>
between the 15th and the 20th of August, 2024, although much of the
groundwork was laid in the year before. Due to the constant output of my
wrting, I often liberally salvage from unpublished prior works to
assemble new ones, this process is at work here. I hoped originally to
include more “fun” elements in this site, like minigames and interactive
segments, but those were cut in the interests of not losing focus and
time. The contents of these essays (everything on this page and as specified in the Table of Contents below) is available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> license. I would love if you wanted to work with me on anything I mention here, but that&rsquo;s not a requirement.</p>
<p>Anyways, enough preamble. Here are some of the things I believe now, a
loose collection of thoughts that have defined me up to this point.
Perhaps I will come to regret these beliefs. But that’s a problem for
future me. </p>
